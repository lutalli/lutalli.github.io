*Madoka Runes* are the runes featured in the anime [Puella Magi Madoka Magica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puella_Magi_Madoka_Magica), originally created by [Gekidan Inu Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gekidan_Inu_Curry). They cover the [German alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_alphabet), which includes A, B, ..., Z with the addition of Ä, Ö, Ü and ß, as well as the numerals 0, 1, ... 9. For further details, see [this page](https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Deciphering_the_runes) on the Puella Magi Wiki.

Below is my own handwritten version of Madoka Runes.

Concept: Fast-to-write; minimal; letter-like rather than rune-like.

In addition to regular uppercase and lowercase letters, I have also provided an italic variant.

## Remarks

- Compared to the original design of the letter [Bb], the cross-shaped "+" inside the ring has been simplified to a dot.
- The lowercase forms of some letters are vertically extended, such as [Hh], [Oo], [Pp], [Ww]. This is comparable to Latin letters like Hh, Jj, Ll, Pp.
- In some cases the regular lowercase form is not vertically extended, but its italic variation is. This applies to letters such as [Gg], [Ii], [Ll], [Rr].
- The original design of the letter [Ss] consists of three vertically aligned dots, which looks very similar to a vertical ellipsis. Since dots and ellipsises appear quite often in mathematical writing, it has been slightly redesigned to avoid visual ambiguity.
- The stick-like letter [Vv] has its italic form flipped so that it shares the same slope as other italic letters.
- Two different designs are provided for the lowercase letter [x]. The second variant shall be used for an [x] positioned at the end of a word, e.g. *fox*, *matrix*. This is comparable to the Greek letter σ/ς. It is also recommended to use the second variant for the mathematical variable $x$. Otherwise, the first variant should be used.
- Compared to the original design of the numeral 0, the "×" inside the egg has been simplified to a dot.
- Other variations, such as bold and double-struck, can be easily improvised, like $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ in the examples above.
