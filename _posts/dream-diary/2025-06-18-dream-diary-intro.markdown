## What it is about

Records of dreams I've experienced.

I don't include every dream in the diary. Whether I choose to write one down depends on several factors, such as

- how clearly I can remember the dream;
- how difficult it is to express the dream in words;
- how much personal or sensitive information the dream reveals;
- how motivated I feel.

## How it is organized

After waking up from a sleep session, once I decide to record a dream, I will first quickly write down everything I can remember about the dreams on my phone (except the parts that I don't want). This will become a draft. Before publishing it to the website, I have to spend time on editing it, focusing on clarity and readability.

Many such drafts have been piled up in the past several years. Though, due to procrastination, most of them haven't been edited yet. That's why only a few dreams are currently present on the website.

The dream diary is published in monthly bundles. Individual dreams from the same sleep session are labeled chronologically using capital latin letters: **A**, **B**, **C** and so on. The date assigned to a sleep session is the date on which the sleep session *ended*. Sometimes a dream is divided into several sections, which are further labeled with Arabic numerals, e.g. **B-1**, **B-2**, **B-3**.

> The *dreams* from a sleep session are stories that are clearly disconnected from one another. The discontinuity may result from sleep phases that have no dreams or gaps in memory. The *sections* indicate brief skips within the same dream.

## How it is written

Here're some principles I follow when writing and editing the dreams:

- **Everything is based solely on my memory.** While I often omit parts of the dream, I never make up or over-edit the content.
- **Minimize unnecessary words that are irrelevant to the content.** For example, linking words like *then*, *later* or *besides* are pretty much avoided. Dreams contain a lot of illogical things, but they won't be explicitly suggested using words like *but* or *however* (except sometimes the <dr-contra></dr-contra> symbol - see below). Instead, the absurdity is presented plainly, like a movie without commentary.<br />The feelings of confuse and surprise we have about the dreams only come from reviewing the dreams. They don't belong to the dreams. But if such feelings do appear inside the dreams, relevant words may be used and will very likely be marked with special symbols (see below).
- **Reduce repeated expressions,** such as "I saw ...", "... appeared", "there was ...". Since the majority of a dream is visual, these phrases are often implied.

The following notation system is used to support these goals.

        <td style="text-align: left;">Texts that are set apart from the primary text, which mainly provide context regarding location, environment, time, atmosphere or mental state.<br />Two different colors are used to visually separate this kind of text blocks that appear next to each other.</td>

        <td style="text-align: center;"><dr-persp>text</dr-persp></td>
        <td style="text-align: left;">Perspective.<br /><dr-t><dr-persp>game</dr-persp></dr-t> does not mean "I was playing a game at computer", rather "only the screen of a game was present in the dream" - there was no computer or someone explicitly using the computer (if there were, I would say so). It is as if the game was in fullscreen mode in the dream and the concept of "I" was fused into the game.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><dr-recog>text</dr-recog></td>
        <td style="text-align: left;">Fuzzy recognition.<br />Most of the narrative describes what I clearly recognized (which I would call a <em>direct recognition</em>). In contrast, fuzzy recognition captures impressions that felt familiar but weren't fully identifiable.<br /><dr-recog>cat</dr-recog> means something that gave me the feeling of a cat but I wouldn't say <em>was</em> a cat.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><dr-think>text</dr-think></td>
        <td style="text-align: left;">Inner experience.<br />When applied to a <em>sentence</em>: Indicates a thought process, perception, or assumption. It can be considered as a shorthand for expressions like "I think ..." or "I assume ...".<br />When applied to a <em>word</em>: Suggests that the word carries an inner feeling in the dream. For example, <dr-think>however</dr-think> may reflect a feeling that something was unexpected or illogical.</td>
