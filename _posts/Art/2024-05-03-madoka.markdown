*Madoka Runes* are the runes that appeared in the anime [Puella Magi Madoka Magica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puella_Magi_Madoka_Magica), originally created by [Gekidan Inu Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gekidan_Inu_Curry). The table of Madoka Runes basically covers the [German alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_alphabet) — which is identical to the English alphabet A, B, ..., Z plus Ä, Ö, Ü and ß — as well as the numerals 0, 1, ... 9. For more details, read [this page](https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Deciphering_the_runes) on Puella Magi Wiki.

In the following my own handwritten font of Madoka Runes is presented. Concept: Fast-to-write, minimal, letter-like rather than rune-like.

Besides the regular font of uppercase and lowercase letters, I also provided the italic variation of them. The primary motivation for this is that I'm attempting to replace Latin letters in my mathematical writing by Madoke Runes, where variables are usually written in italic. This can be observed in the examples below.

For a satisfying image quality, I scanned the documents instead of photographing them.

## Remarks

- Compared to the letter [Bb]'s original design, the cross form "+" inside the ring is simplified to a dot.
- The lowercase of some letters is "vertically stretched", like [Hh], [Oo], [Pp], [Ww]. This is comparable with the Latin letters Hh, Jj, Ll, Pp, etc.
- Sometimes the lowercase in regular form is not "vertically stretched", but its italic variation does, like [Gg], [Ii], [Ll], [Rr].
- The original design of the letter [Ss] is three vertically arranged dots, which looks very similar to a vertical ellipsis. In consideration of mathematical writing, where dots and ellipsises appear quite often, it is slightly new designed, so that visual confusion can be reduced.
- The stick-like letter [Vv]'s italic form is flipped, so that it has the same slope as other italic letters.
- Notice that two different designs of the lowercase letter [x] are provided. The second one should be used if it is positioned at the end of a word, like *fox*, *matrix*, etc. This is comparable with the greek letter σ/ς. It's also recommended to use this form for the mathematical variable $x$. Otherwise the first one should be used.
- Compared to the original design of the numeral 0, the form "×" inside the egg is simplified to a dot.
- Other variations like bold and double-struck can be easily improvised, like the double-struck font for $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ in one of the examples above.
