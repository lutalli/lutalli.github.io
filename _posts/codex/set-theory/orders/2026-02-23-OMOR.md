> - Let $(X,\leq)$ and $(Y,\leq')$ be two [partially ordered sets](/codex/PO) and $f:X\to Y$ be a [function](/codex/F). $f$ is an **order homomorphism**, also called **order-preserving** / **monotone** / **isotone**, if for all $a$, $b\in X$,
>
>   $$ a\leq b \enspace\Rightarrow\enspace f(a)\leq' f(b). $$
>
>   If $\leq$ and $\leq'$ are additionally [total](/codex/TPO), then $f$ is also called **increasing**.
>
> - An **order isomorphism** is a [bijective](/codex/BIJ) order homomorphism.
>
> - An **order endomorphism** is an order homomorphism from a partially ordered set $(X,\leq)$ to itself.
>
> - An **order automorphism** is an order endomorphism that is an order isomorphism.
>
> - Two partially ordered sets $(X,\leq)$ and $(Y,\leq')$ are **isomorphic**, if an order isomorphism between them exists.
