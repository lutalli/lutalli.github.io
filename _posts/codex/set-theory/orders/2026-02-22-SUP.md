> Let $(X,\leq)$ be a [partially ordered set](/codex/PO). Let $A\subseteq X$ and $a\in X$.
>
> - If the [least](/codex/MAX) [upper bound](/codex/UPB) of $A$ exists, it is called the **supremum** of $A$ and written as $\sup A$.
>
> - If the greatest lower bound of $A$ exists, it is called the **infimum** of $A$ and written as $\inf A$.
