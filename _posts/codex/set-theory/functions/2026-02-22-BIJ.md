> <span class="math-h">DEF-BIJ. Bijection.</span>
>
> A **bijection** / **one-to-one correspondence** is a [function](/codex/F) that is both an [injection](/codex/INJ) and an [surjection](/codex/SUR), i.e. an injection $f:X\to Y$ such that $\operatorname{ran}f=Y$.

> <span class="math-h">REM-BIJ.</span>
>
> Since surjectivity is not an intrinsic property ([REM-SUR](/codex/SUR#REM-SUR)), nor is bijectivity.
>
> We can make every injection a bijection by choosing its range as its codomain.
