>
> A **surjection** / **onto function** is a [function](/codex/F) $f:X\to Y$ that is [surjective](/codex/RP#DEF-RP), i.e. for all $y\in Y$ there is an $x\in X$ such that $f(x)=y$. In other words, $\operatorname{ran}f=Y$.

> <span class="math-h">REM-SUR.</span>
>
> Notice that surjectivity of a function is not an intrinsic property, since the codomain is not intrinsic ([REM-F-COD](/codex/F#REM-F-COD)).
>
> We can make every function surjective by choosing its range as its codomain.
