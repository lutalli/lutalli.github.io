The Spring Festival was becoming more and more boring.

Three frozen, thumb-sized penguins. A warm kettle on the table. I attached one penguin onto the kettle surface and it came to life. I planned to create an ecosystem for them to live in, collecting a lot of materials, including a plastic box and some circuit components.

### I

I launched my computer; the *value* was displayed slightly above 60%, anormal - the *value* had to be at least 100% to be called *normal*. I contacted one of my classmates, the same problem was reported. I contacted W in chat, the same scene was shown. This situation must be caused by some certain factor, I conjectured. W and his PC's main unit next to me, making loud noises. After I fixed some component of the main unit the noises were gone and the *value* went back to *normal*, verifying the conjecture and W returned into the chat.

### II

Next to the classroom podium one of my classmates was giving a speech. As he - according to the unfinished previews on the left side of the screen - hadn't finished everything yet, another classmate came, covering up the first speaker, telling the audience that they didn't complete their presentation and apologized, while the first speaker kept silent.

`mudflat``gloomy sky``gray` Several people were scatteredly standing on the mudflat, just above their ankles reached the water level. A man captured [Koro-Sensei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_Classroom) from a well, looked proud; Koro-Sensei totally wet, his tentacles drooping, looking down with inferiority.

Koro-Sensei standing in the distance, behind a couple of people; and disappeared in a blink. *After all, he is really fast.*
