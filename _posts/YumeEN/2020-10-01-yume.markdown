The Spring Festival was getting more and more boring.

Three frozen, thumb-sized penguins. A warm kettle on the table. I attached one penguin onto the kettle's surface and it came to life. I planned to create an ecosystem for the penguins to live in; looking for a lot of materials, including a plastic box and some circuit components.

### I

I launched my computer; the displayed *value* was slightly above 60%, which was anormal - the *value* had to be at least 100% to be called *normal*. I contacted one of my classmates, he reported the same problem. I contacted W in chat; the *value* was shown as about 60% as well. I conjectured this situation was caused by some certain factor. W and his PC's main unit next to me, making loud noises. After I fixed some component of the main unit the noises were gone and the *value* went back to *normal*, verifying the conjecture and W went back into the chat.

### II

One of my classmates was giving a speech in the front of the classroom. As he obviously hadn't finished everything yet - according to the previews on the left side of the screen, not all slides had been shown - Another classmate came, covered up the first speaker, telling the audience that they didn't complete their presentation and apologized; the first speaker kept silent.

`mudflat``gloomy sky``gray` Several people were scatteredly standing on the mudflat, the water level reached just above their ankles. A man captured [Koro-Sensei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_Classroom) from a well. The man looked proud; Koro-Sensei totally wet, his tentacles drooping, looking down with inferiority.

Standing behind a couple of people was Koro-Sensei in the distance; and disappeared in a blink. *After all, he is really fast.*
