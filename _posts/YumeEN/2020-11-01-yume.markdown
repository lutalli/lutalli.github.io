### I.1

My mother, my cousin and I and so on shopping at a *bakery*. The German writing exam started; I assumed I had to complete the essay task given by my Chinese teacher. Based on the chapter *Life* of manga [*Girls' Last Tour*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls%27_Last_Tour) I started writing an article titled *What is Life*. After a couple of paragraphs I realized this was a German exam so I scratched everything off. Only 4 seconds left `panic`.

### I.2

*Someone, closely the first-person perspective*, and *someone who was ████* were discussing something in the *meeting room* on *the fifth floor*.

### II

`third-person perspective` I caught a fever `pain``a living hell`.

I carefully zipped up the mosquito net. However, there was a gap on each of the left and right sides.

## Nov. 13, 2020

I was looking out from the window in my bedroom, which a horrible insect was flying towards. Illuminating the insect using a red point laser `red, dark sky`, a while, and the laser began to take effect; burns spreaded on its body, which began to grow and transform. *Induced mutation*. After the insect flew into my room its blood spilt all over the floor. I went out before it left the room, did something and returned, realizing "heading out without cleaning up" as a mistake. Consequently, more insects appeared on my bed. Tiny bugs at first, which seemed not incubated for long and some of which looked like shrunken maggots, then a group of varicolored insects in strange shapes.

> During the dream and after waking up, those insects didn't appear disgusting. Instead, the fuzzy images of those insects were artistic.
